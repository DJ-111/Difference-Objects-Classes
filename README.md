# Difference-Objects-Classes

Objects:
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. Objects have states and behaviors. For example, a dog has states - color, name, breed, as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object can represent real-world entities like a car, a person, or even more abstract concepts like a database connection or a graphical user interface button. For instance, if you create an object from the Car class, you might instantiate it with make as "Toyota", model as "Corolla", year as 2020, and methods to manipulate the car's state.

Classes:
A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit. A class can contain fields (variables) and methods to define the behavior of an object. For example, you can have a class Car that includes fields like make, model, year, and methods like start(), drive(), and stop(). Each class provides the structure that objects created from the class will follow.

Differences:

Definition vs. Instantiation: A class is a definition of an object. It describes what an object will look like and how it will behave. An object is a specific instance of a class. For example, Car is a class that defines what a car is. myCar is an object created from the Car class with specific values for make, model, and year.

Blueprint vs. Product: Think of a class as a blueprint for a house. The blueprint itself is not a house but a guide to build one. An object is like a house built from the blueprint. Multiple houses can be built using the same blueprint, and each house is an independent structure. Similarly, you can create multiple objects from a single class.

Single vs. Multiple: You can create multiple objects from a single class. Each object will have its own set of instance variables. For example, you can create multiple instances of the Car class, each with its own unique attributes. car1 might be a black Ram 2500 from 2022, while car2 might be a red Dodge Challenger from 2018. Each object operates independently of others, even though they are created from the same class blueprint.

Behavior and State: Classes define behaviors (methods) and states (fields). Objects embody these behaviors and states. For example, a Car class may have methods like accelerate() and brake(). Each Car object can perform these methods, and the outcome will depend on the object's current state, such as its current speed or fuel level.
